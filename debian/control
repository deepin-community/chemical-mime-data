Description: chemical MIME and file type support for desktops
 The chemical media type and various subtypes have been proposed by
 Henry Rzepa, Peter-Murray Rust and Benjamin Whitaker in 1996 as an
 addition to the existing MIME types. The proposal didn't succeed
 but various applications make use of these MIME/file types. This
 package adds support to Linux desktops to detect and recognize
 files of the chemical/* media type.
